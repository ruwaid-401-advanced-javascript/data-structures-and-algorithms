# graph

Implement Graph Data structure.  The graph should be represented as an adjacency list

## Challenge

* getEdge()
  get edges

## Approach & Efficiency

i used class 
### BIG O
#### graph 
* getEdge Method
  * space --> Big O = O(1) -->  constant space always will add a one memory location
  * time --> Big O = O(n) -->  time varies as number of nodes increase or decrease



## Solution
