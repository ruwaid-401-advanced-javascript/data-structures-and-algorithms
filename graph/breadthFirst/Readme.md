# graph

Implement Graph Data structure.  The graph should be represented as an adjacency list

## Challenge

* breadthFirst()
 search in the graph
## Approach & Efficiency

i used class 
### BIG O
#### graph 
* breadthFirst Method
  * space --> Big O = O(n) -->  space varies as number of nodes increase or decrease
  * time --> Big O = O(n) -->  time varies as number of nodes increase or decrease

## Solution
